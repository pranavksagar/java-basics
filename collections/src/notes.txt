## Collections Framework

Java Collections is not just a library with util classes that you can use but it is a framework that guides you to
implement your own collections as well. It is a high performing and optimal tool which is optimized as much as possible.
It offers good preset data structures.

What the collections framework provides?

1. Core interfaces (eg. List)
2. Implementations (eg. ArrayList)
3. Abstract Implementations (eg. AbstractList) - These are the reason why it is a framework and not a library
4. Concurrent Implementations (eg. ConcurrentHashMap) - Takes care of thread safety. Implementations aren't by default thread safe
5. Algorithms (Sorting, Binary Search)
6. Utilities (eg Arrays.compare())


Collections Interfaces-

1. Collection
2. Map (Map is different as it is not just a collection of a single object but a collection of key-value pairs)
